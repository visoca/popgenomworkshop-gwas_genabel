# Genome-wide Association Studies (GWAS) in structured populations using GenABEL
#### Originally developed by Michael Stocks
#### Modified and delivered by Victor Soria-Carrasco

The aim of this practical is to identify markers associated with male mating behaviour in the ruff. We will use the dataset of [*Küpper et al. (2016)*](http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v48/n1/full/ng.3443.html) and attempt to identify markers underlying the "female-mimic" *Faeder* morph. For this, we will use the `R` package [GenABEL](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/GenABEL/versions/1.8-0), and by the end of the tutorial you should be able to:

* Perform a genome-wide association study
* Add covariates to the model
* Account for multiple testing
* Correct for population stratification

## Getting started
Inside your home directly type the following to download the tutorial and data:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/visoca/popgenomworkshop-gwas_genabel
```

This will create a file called `gwas-workshop`. Move into the directory and decompress the data:
```bash
cd popgenomworkshop-gwas_genabel
gunzip gen_RUFF_qc.raw.gz
```

If you type `ls` and `ENTER` in the terminal then you should see two files. `gen_RUFF_qc.raw` was generated from `VCF` format using `plink` and contains the genotypic information for each marker and individual. `phe_RUFF.txt` is a tab-delimited file containing the phenotypes for each individual.

Type `R` and enter to begin an `R` session. You can exit at any time by typing `q()` to get back to the `unix` environment.

## Installing GenABEL
GenABEL is unfortunately no longer actively maintained and has been archived in the CRAN repository. To install it you will have to run the following commands:
```R
install.packages("https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/GenABEL.data/GenABEL.data_1.0.0.tar.gz", repos=NULL, type="source")
install.packages("https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/GenABEL/GenABEL_1.8-0.tar.gz", repos=NULL, type="source")
```
If asked about setting up a local library, answer `Yes` and accept the suggested location.

If you want to work with GenABEL on Windows, you will have to install the binaries from this repository:
```R
install.packages("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/visoca/popgenomworkshop-gwas_genabel/master/GenABEL.data_1.0.0.zip", repos=NULL)
install.packages("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/visoca/popgenomworkshop-gwas_genabel/master/GenABEL_1.8-0.zip", repos=NULL)
```

## Importing and exploring the data
First, load the library:
```r
library(GenABEL)
```
Now import the data and assign the object to the variable `ruff.data`:
```r
ruff.data <- load.gwaa.data(phe = "phe_RUFF.txt", gen = "gen_RUFF_qc.raw", force = T)
```
We'll now do some basic filtering to remove uninformative markers and to decrease the size of the dataset:
```r
qc <- check.marker(ruff.data, callrate = 0.66, p.level = 1e-5, perid.call = 0, extr.perid.call = 0, ibs.mrk = -1)
ruff.clean <- ruff.data[qc$idok, qc$snpok]
```
We will not go into the details of these filters but more information is available [here](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/GenABEL/versions/1.8-0/topics/check.marker).

A brief overview of the data are given for the traits or the markers using the following two commands:
```r
descriptives.trait(ruff.clean)
descriptives.marker(ruff.clean)
```
The data consists of 41 male ruff individuals. The phenotypic data is contained in a data frame given by the `phdata` method. Using the command `table(ruff.clean@phdata[, "morph"])`, you can see that of the three different morphs: 21 are *Independent*, 10 are *Satellite* and 10 are *Faeder*. Each of these morphs has a number of distinct physiological and behavioural phenotypes (see table below) that have been shown through breeding experiments to be Mendelian inherited traits (Lank *et al.* [1995](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v378/n6552/abs/378059a0.html), [2013](http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/9/6/20130653)).

The genotypic data consists of markers derived from RAD sequencing, and have been mapped to the ruff draft genome. See [*Küpper et al. (2016)*](http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v48/n1/full/ng.3443.html), and it's sister publication [*Lamichhaney et al. (2016)*](http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v48/n1/full/ng.3430.html), for more details. After filtering we now have a dataset of 383,514 snps with which to look for associations with the trait of interest. 

## Perform an association study
We will start with some simple tests of association the *Faeder* morph trait. That is, are there markers associated with an individual being either a *Faeder* or a non-*Faeder* (i.e. a *Satellite* or *Independent*) morph? This trait is indicated by the phenotype `fo` and is a categorical trait. We will start by using the fast score test method:
```r
fo.QT <- qtscore(fo ~ 1, data = ruff.clean, trait = "binomial")
```
This then gives us a *p*-value for association between each marker and the `fo` trait. A breakdown of the 10 most significant associations can be produced using the `summary()` command:
```r
summary(fo.QT)
```
You can also increase the number of markers displayed in the summary:
```r
summary(fo.QT, top = 30)
```
This gives information about the location (`Chromosome`, `Position`) of each marker and the significance of the association (`P1df`). We will deal with the `Pc1df` column in the population stratification section (more details on the columns are given [here](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/GenABEL/versions/1.8-0/topics/scan.gwaa-class.html)). You can also check how many markers are below a certain significance threshold:
```r
sum(fo.QT[, "P1df"] <= 0.0001)
```
We can also produce a Manhattan plot and write it to a pdf to better understand our data:
```r
pdf("fo_qt_manhattan.pdf", width = 12, height = 7)
plot(fo.QT, col = c("black", "black"), ystart = 1)
dev.off()
```
Now, exit `R` using the `q()` command (saying `yes` to save the workspace) and type `ls`, you should see a pdf file in your current working directory. To view it in the Windows environment, email to yourself using the following command, replacing `user@email.com` with your email address:
```bash
echo "Text body" | mail -s "QT plot" -a fo_qt_manhattan.pdf user@email.com
```
The manhattan plot shows the `-log10(p)` values against the base-pair position of each marker on each chromosome (or contig in this case). Larger values mean that the association is more significant. Type `R` to enter the `R` environment again and then reload GenABEL once again with `library(GenABEL)` (the rest of your data will still be loaded).

## Correct for multiple tests
Due to the number of tests being performed (equal to the number of markers), we would expect some significant results by chance alone. There are numerous ways to do this (e.g. Bonferroni correction, FDR etc...), one of which is to use permutations of the data to find a signifance cut-off threshold. This randomly shuffles the phenotypic values with respect to the individual genotypes at each marker. This creates independence between the trait and the markers and can be used to generate a suitable significance threshold. This can be done using the `qtscore` function, using the `times` option to specify 100 permutations:
```r
fo.QT100 <- qtscore(fo ~ 1, data = ruff.clean, trait = "binomial", times = 100)
```
Using the `summary()` command, you can see that the *p*-values in the `P1df` column have been adjusted to account for multiple testing and indicate the proportion of permutations yielding a more significant *p*-value than that observed in the real data. 

## Population stratification
Structure can create artificial associations between markers and phenotypes. In natural populations, there are a number of ways to use non-causal markers to account for any population stratification. We will look at two methods:

1) The first method uses all markers in the dataset to measure the level of statification within the population. This value (often known as lambda) is then used to correct the *p*-values from the association test. The value of lamdba can be obtained with:
```r
lambda(fo.QT)
```
A value of 1 indicates no stratification, and everything above that means that there may be some form of structure in the population. The corrected *p*-values are given by the `summary()` command under the `Pc1df` heading.

2) Another method is to first estimate identity-by-state (IBS) and kinship information from the marker dataset, perform multidimensional scaling on these IBS coefficients, and then use these as covariants in the model. First, get the kinship matrix:
```r
gkin <- ibs(ruff.clean)
```
Then perform the multidimensional scaling:
```r
mds <- cmdscale(as.dist(0.5 - gkin))
```
And add these as covariates in the model:
```r
fo.QTibs <- qtscore(fo ~ mds[, 1] + mds[, 2], data = ruff.clean, trait.type = "binomial")
```
As before, you can view the *p*-values using the `summary()` command, and produce Manhattan plots using `plot()`.
